# tetris
A tetris implementation in C

Pretty much says it all. You run it, you play tetris.

If you #define WINDOWS it will compile for Windows, and if you #define LINUX it will compile for Linux.

It plays only with the left hand, so you can keep your right hand on the mouse and pretend you are working :P

lconio.h offers Linux implementations of Window's conio.h kbhit() and getch().
